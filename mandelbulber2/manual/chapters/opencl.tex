The use of OpenCL \index{termination condition!maxiter} enables offloading the rendering of the fractal to the
GPU (graphics processing unit) or to an accelerator card. This can greatly reduce the render time.
OpenCL itself is an industry standard developed by the Khronos group and
is a well-established framework. The two major GPU vendors (ATI and Nvidia)
among others implement the OpenCL specification in their drivers.
OpenCL uses single-precision floating-point accuracy, so the minimum camera-to-surface distance is about 1e-04, whereas this distance can be reduced to about 1e-09 with OpenCL disabled. Therefore OpenCL is not suitable for zooming down into fine-detailed areas.

\subsection{Setup of OpenCL}\label{setup-opencl}
To render in Mandelbulber with OpenCL, you will need to install a recent driver.
The newest GPU driver available can be obtained from the links in the next table. Download and install the driver file.

\end{center}

You should also be able to use free drivers, if they support OpenCL.
Unfortunately, the performance of those drivers is often below the performance of the proprietary ones.

\subsubsection{Setup of OpenCL on Windows}\label{setup-opencl-windows}
\emph{Note: Windows users are likely to need to edit the registry to avoid timeout errors, refer \ref{opencl-troubleshooting}}.

With a capable GPU, a recent driver, the registry edit completed and the system rebooted, then the Mandelbulber program can be loaded.
Proceed with \ref{configure-opencl}. 

\subsubsection{Setup of OpenCL on Linux}\label{setup-opencl-linux}
With a capable GPU and a recent driver, the Mandelbulber program can be loaded.
Proceed with \ref{configure-opencl}. 
If you are a developer and compile your own Mandelbulber version,
you will need to have the package \textbf{opencl-headers} installed in the system.  
See also the corresponding README.

\subsection{Configuring OpenCL}\label{configure-opencl}
Open Mandelbulber and navigate to: Menu > File > Program Preferences > OpenCL (GPU).
You will find the configuration page in figure \ref{opencl_tab}.

\simpleImageWithCaption75Width{img/manual/media/opencl_tab.png}
{OpenCL Tab in preferences}
{opencl_tab}{h}

\begin{itemize}
	\item First, you need to enable OpenCL by enabling the checkbox.
	
	\item Then you need to select the platform and device to identify the OpenCL hardware 
		element to render with.
		
	\item Select the devices which you want to use for rendering. Many devices can be used simultaneously. At least one device needs to be selected.
%	\item \textbf{Precision} - Switch between float and double precision
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item \textbf{float} - gives high performance render, but is limited in precision, 
%			sometimes this mode can result in artifacts and bad DE.
%		\item \textbf{double}- gives lower performance render (at least by factor 2), but has the same accuracy as the non OpenCL version. This mode may prevent artifacts.
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item \textbf{Mode} - Switches the rendering engine between different levels of shader extent.
	\item \textbf{Mode} - This setting is located in the Navigation dock just below the RENDER button (figure \ref{opencl_mode}). It switches the rendering engine between different levels of shader extent.
	
		\simpleImageWithCaptionHalfWidth{img/manual/media/opencl_mode.png}{OpenCL Mode in Navigation dock}
	{opencl_mode}{h}
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textbf{no OpenCL} - temporarily disables OpenCL  Rendering is done by CPU.
	\item  \textbf{fast} - renders preview of the fractal shape. The appearance of the fractal is not realistic, but the rendering is very fast.
	\item  \textbf{medium} - image is rendered with correct surface colors, but volumetric effects, reflection and refraction of light is not calculated. There is used only first defined material. This mode offers more realistic rendering than in \emph{fast} mode and uses less graphics card resources than in \emph{full} mode. 
	\item  \textbf{full} - renders all effects.	
\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Percentage of reserved GPU time for a system} - rendering using OpenCL can slow down the system when the same graphics card is used as the display adapter and also for rendering. To be able to use the system, you can reserve a small percentage of GPU time for other programs.
	
	\item \textbf{Memory Limit} - Memory limit in MB for the device. Most graphics cards cannot handle memory objects larger than 1/4 of the total memory installed in the graphics card. It is recommended to set the memory limit to not greater than the value suggested below the slider.  
	
	If you observe that SSAO or DOF effects fail during rendering you can try to decrease this limit. When the program needs more memory (image resolution too high), then the effects will be rendered using CPU.
	
	\item \textbf{Use fast relaxed math} - It speeds up rendering but can cause unexpected behavior on old graphics cards.
	 
	\item \textbf{Disable cache of OpenCL programs} - clears and disable cache for OpenCL programs used by NVidia drivers. When cache is disabled, then OpenCL programs are compiled before every render.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Troubleshooting OpenCL}\label{opencl-troubleshooting}

\subsubsection{Driver crash under Windows}

When Mandelbulber is run under Windows, the OS will monitor the GPU with a watchdog. When the card becomes unresponsive for more than two seconds, the driver will shutdown and crash with a message like:

\emph{The NVIDIA OpenGL driver lost connection with the display driver due to exceeding the Windows Time-Out limit and is unable to continue.}

Mandelbulber will show messages like \emph{Cannot enqueue OpenCL output buffers}.

It can happen when there are enabled effects which make rendering of each pixel very long. 

A workaround for this problem is to increase this timeout limit. To do so you need to add or modify two keys in the windows registry. Beware: Do this at your own risk, changing any wrong keys in the windows registry may cause windows to stop working properly!

Change of registry takes effect after restart of Windows.

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item \textbf{Open registry editor:} [Start] > Run > Type in "Regedit" > Hit Enter
	\item \textbf{Navigate to key:} Open \emph{HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE > System > CurrentControlSet > Control > GraphicsDrivers}
	\item \textbf{Create the keys (Modify if exist):}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Create key of type \textbf{DWORD (32-bit)} and name \textbf{TdrDelay} with a value of \textbf{30} as Decimal value.
		\item Create key of type \textbf{DWORD (32-bit)} and name \textbf{TdrDdiDelay} with a value of \textbf{30} as Decimal value.	
	\end{enumerate}	
	\item \textbf{Reboot}

\end{enumerate}

Instead of manual registry edits you can use \emph{TDR\_disable.bat} script located in the program folder. You have to run it as administrator.

Occasionally, sytem and driver updates have appeared to remove these changes to the registry. To date this has been noticed with Win10 OS and Nvidia driver updates. If OpenCL begins to crash after an update, then check the registry.
