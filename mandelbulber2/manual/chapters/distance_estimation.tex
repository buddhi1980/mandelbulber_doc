\section{Distance Estimation}\label{distance-estimation}\index{distance estimation}

Distance Estimation (DE) is the calculation of an estimated distance from the
given point to the nearest surface of the fractal. As suggested by the word
'estimate', it is an approximate value. It is calculated using simplified
algorithms based on analytical (Analytical DE)\index{distance estimation!analytical} or numerical (Delta DE)\index{distance estimation!delta DE}
calculations of gradients.

DE is the most important algorithm required to render three-dimensional fractals
within a reasonable time.  A ray is traced from the camera for each pixel (1000 x 1000 resolution = 1,000,000 rays). They match FOV from the camera eye (i.e., they are not
parallel).

The DE provides an approximation of where along a ray the fractal surface should be located. This provides a starting point for stepping along the ray while looking for the surface location.
The process of stepping along the ray and testing for the surface location, is called ray-marching.

Without the DE calculation, the proximity of the fractal surface would need to be repeatedly calculated after each of many very small steps along the ray from the camera. For example, without an estimate of where the fractal surface is, you may need up to 10,000 steps to trace a ray of light, for every pixel of the image.

Ray marching\index{ray marching} looks like the illustration below. In each step, an estimation on
the distance to the nearest fractal surface is calculated. The calculation point is moved
along the ray by this distance. The next step is re-calculated based on the
estimated distance. This distance is smaller so this time the step is a
smaller distance. The ray-marching becomes more accurate closer to the surface
of the fractal. The ray marching ceases when a step moves the calculation point to be within a set
``distance threshold''\index{ray marching!distance threshold} from the surface or after a maximum number of iterations
if the option ``stop at maximum iteration'' is enabled.

Since the estimation contains some error (sometimes quite large), there is a risk that a step will be too large, and incorrectly step past the fractal surface. This may result in visible noise in the rendered image.

To prevent this, the step can be multiplied by a number between 0 and 1 (\emph{ray-marching step multiplier}\index{ray marching!step multiplier}). Steps are then smaller, so there is less risk of ``overstepping'' the surface (better image quality), but the rendering time increases due to more steps being required (figure \ref{distance_estimation_defactor_1}, \ref{distance_estimation_defactor_05}).

Each formula has assigned a DE mode and function (``automatic''). In most cases
the automatic \emph{mode} is \emph{Analytical DE} (fastest).

The automatic \emph{function} is assigned based on whether the formula is
transforming in a linear or logarithmic manner. These setting can be varied on
the \emph{Render Engine} tab.

\emph{Analytical DE}\index{distance estimation!analytical} mode is faster than \emph{Delta DE}\index{distance estimation!delta DE} mode to calculate.
However with some formulas only Delta DE mode will produce a good quality image.
The DE modes can be used with either linear or logarithmic DE functions.

Example linear out: $ distance = \frac{r}{\lvert DE \rvert} $

Example logarithmic: $ distance = \frac{0.5 r  \log(r)}{DE} $

The quality produced by the DE mode and function combinations is formula
specific. The setting of formula parameters can also greatly affect the quality
produced by the DE. In some cases the choice of fractal image is determined by
what location and parameters can produce good DE quality.

In the Statistics (figure \ref{dock_statistic}) (enable in \emph{View} menu) you can see \emph{Percentage of
	Wrong Distance Estimations} (``Bad DE''). The statistic is only available in no-OpenCL mode. This number is the percentage of image
pixels which potentially have big errors in distance estimation calculation
(estimated distance was much too high). It is visible as a noise on the image.
As a general rule less than 0.01 is good, but it is case specific and 3.0
sometimes is OK and 0.0001 sometimes is not.

Figure \ref{bad_de_menger_sponge} is an example of Bad DE due to over-stepping. It starts to occur at the corner nearest to the camera, resulting in the black areas and distintegration of the fractal. If the ray-marching step multiplier is set even higher, the fractal will entirely disintegrate. This disintegration will generally be reflected in the Percentage of Wrong Distance Estimations statistic.

Figure \ref{linear_de_offset} shows the Linear DE offset parameter located in the Hybrids tab.
For standard mandelbox types and IFS, there are two similar analytic distance estimation calculations used. When making a hybrid that mixes these types, adjusting the Linear DE offset parameter can assist in fine tuning the DE calculation.

Generic  linear : $ out.distance = \frac{r - offset}{\lvert DE \rvert} $

The Linear DE offset is normally used in the range from 0.0 (mandelbox) to 2.0 (IFS).
